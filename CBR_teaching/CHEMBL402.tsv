The assay is based on the spectrophotometric measurement of the decrease in absorbance at 340 nm of NADPH in solution. A decrease in absorbance is caused by the oxidation of NADPH by the catalytic subunit of HMGR in the presence of the substrate HMG-CoA. Effective inhibition of the HMG-CoA leads to a reduction in oxidation of NADPH which in turn leads to a smaller reduction in the absorbance at 340 nm over time."

A decrease in absorbance is caused by the oxidation of NADPH by the catalytic subunit of HMGR in the presence of the substrate HMG-CoA. Effective inhibition of the HMG-CoA leads to a reduction in oxidation of NADPH which in turn leads to a smaller reduction in the absorbance at 340 nm over time."

A decrease in absorbance is caused by the oxidation of NADPH by the catalytic subunit of HMGR in the presence of the substrate HMG-CoA.
